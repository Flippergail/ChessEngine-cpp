Make moves in the format which square you want to move a piece from to the square you want to move it to e.g "a2a4" would move
the piece on square a2 to square a4 and if there was a piece on that square capture it.

If you want to go back a move in the match type "-1"

If you want to promote a pawn, move it in the same format as said before to the promotion square, then type
a space then either b, n, r or q to promote it to e.g "f7f8 q"
