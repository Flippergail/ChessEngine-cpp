### 🧑🏽‍🏫 A Good Example of Class Structures 🧑🏽‍🏫
This chess program is a great example of how to code more complex class structures with inheritance and polymorphism in c++
which can be used to help your learning of c++.

### 💻 How to use: 💻
Make moves in the format which square you want to move a piece from to the square you want to move it to e.g "a2a4" would move
the piece on square a2 to square a4 and if there was a piece on that square capture it.

If you want to go back a move in the match type "-1"

If you want to promote a pawn, move it in the same format as said before to the promotion square, then type
a space then either b, n, r or q to promote it to e.g "f7f8 q"
